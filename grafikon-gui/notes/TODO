TODO
    - highlight selected time interval for train ...
    - add filtering in trains' list
    - adding output points to nodes (especially stations :)
    - lines - adding different parts (different speed and possibly other information) ...

NEW TODO
    - added backward references to trains diagram (for example for formatting train name ...)
        -> it would greatly simplify things (I wouldn't have to pass stupid name pattern around)
        -> change constructors to friend (factory methods in TrainDiagram and other classes)
    - locking access to the train diagram - it would remove problems with concurrent modification (especially
        with recalculating trains)
    - finish update interval instead of add/remove for route parts (nodes and lines)
    - finish events viewer implementation (converters)
