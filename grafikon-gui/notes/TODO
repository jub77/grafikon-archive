TODO
    - highlight selected time interval for train ...
    - add filtering in trains' list
    - adding output points to nodes (especially stations :)
    - lines - adding different parts (different speed and possibly other information) ...
    - thread safe implementation of train diagram - the question is if it is
      something that would solve GUI problems (at least it wouldn't solve
      problems with events and EDT)

NEW TODO
    - finish events viewer implementation (converters)
    - extend events with some additional values - e.g.
