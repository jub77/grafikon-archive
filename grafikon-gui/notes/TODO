TODO
    - highlight selected time interval for train ...
    - add filtering in trains' list
    - adding output points to nodes (especially stations :)
    - lines - adding different parts (different speed and possibly other information) ...

NEW TODO
    - locking access to the train diagram - it would remove problems with concurrent modification (especially
        with recalculating trains)
    - finish events viewer implementation (converters)

    - locking of recalculating (or any other actions that are not in the GUI thread) and locking (read lock)
        of drawing
    - extend events with some additional values - e.g.
